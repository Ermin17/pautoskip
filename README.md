# NOTE: As of the most recent Spotify version, this no longer works due to the advertisement changes. Working on a fix.
# PAutoSkip (Podcast Auto Skip)

PAutoSkip is an Android app that automatically skips ads during Spotify podcasts. It detects when an ad is playing and seamlessly fast-forwards to resume your podcast without interruptions.

## Features

- Detects Spotify ads in real-time
- Automatically skips ads without user intervention
- Runs in the background while you listen
- Lightweight and battery-efficient
- Automatically disconnects when Spotify is no longer detected

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the [releases](https://github.com/Ermin17/pautoskip/releases) page.
2. Install the APK on your Android device.
3. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted.
4. Open Spotify and enjoy not listening to ads.

## Requirements

- Android 8.1+
- Spotify installed and logged in

## How It Works

PAutoSkip listens for Spotify playback events and detects when an ad starts playing. If an ad is detected, it automatically seeks past the ad and resumes your podcast.

## Permissions

- **Foreground Service**: Ensures ad detection runs in the background while you listen.

## Disclaimer

PAutoSkip is not affiliated with or endorsed by Spotify. PAutoSkip does not modify or provide any new features beyond those available within the Spotify app itself.
